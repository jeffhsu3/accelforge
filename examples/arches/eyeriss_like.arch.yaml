    # This component_class invokes the hwcomponents_library.SmartBufferSRAM model. The
    # component is a SRAM buffer with an address register that is updated on every
    # access to queue up the next data.

    attributes:
      # Underscore-prefixed fields go to this library. The underscore prefix tells the
      # parser that these fields are part of the fastfusion specification, and should be
      # strictly type-checked (like most other input fields). Non-underscored attributes
      # are loosely type checked.

      # These attributes are passed to the hwcomponents_library model. In general,
      # energy/area calculation passes every attribute it can to the model, except for
      # those that the model doesn't recognize (like `size` or `datawidth`).

    # Actions that the hwcomponents_library model must support. Like attributes,
    # non-underscored arguments are also loosely type-checked, and all arguments that
    # can are passed to the model's appropriate method (in this case, `read` or
    # `write`). The `_bits_per_action` argument is special because it determines how
    # many bits are transferred by each read or write.
