# This component_class invokes the hwcomponents_library.SmartBufferSRAM model. The
# component is a SRAM buffer with an address register that is updated on every
# access to queue up the next data.
component_class: SmartBufferSRAM

# Attributes describe the component's properties. Underscore-prefixed fields go to this
# library. The underscore prefix tells the parser that these fields are part of the
# fastfusion spec, and should be strictly type-checked (like most other input
# fields). Non-underscored attributes are loosely type checked.

# If no hwcomponents model can be initialized with the given attributes and/or
# component_class, an error will be raised.
attributes:
  _size: width * depth
  _datawidth: 8 # 8 bits per value

  # These attributes are passed to the hwcomponents_library model. In general,
  # energy/area calculation passes every attribute it can to the model, except for
  # those that the model doesn't recognize (like `size` or `datawidth`).
  depth: 512
  width: 32
  n_banks: 32
  tech_node: 65e-9

# Actions that the hwcomponents_library model must support. Like attributes,
# non-underscored arguments are also loosely type-checked, and all arguments that
# can are passed to the model's appropriate method (in this case, `read` or
# `write`). The `_bits_per_action` argument is special because it determines how
# many bits are transferred by each read or write.
actions:
- {name: read, arguments: {_bits_per_action: 64}}
- {name: write, arguments: {_bits_per_action: 64}}
