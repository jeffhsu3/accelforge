Component Modeling
==================

The area and energy of components can be specified in two ways. First, they can be
specified directly using area and energy in the architecture:ref:`architecture`. Second,
they can be calculated automatically using `HWComponents
<https://github.com/Accelergy-Project/hwcomponents>`_.










The area and energy of components in the architecture either be specified directly, or
by calls to the `HWComponents <https://github.com/Accelergy-Project/hwcomponents>`_
