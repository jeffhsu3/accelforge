User Guide
==========

Welcome to the AccelForge user guide. This guide will help you get started with using
AccelForge to design and model tensor algebra accelerators.

Installation
------------

PyPI Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For native installation, install the package from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install accelforge

Using Pre-Built Docker Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pre-built Docker images are available for AccelForge. TODO: Docker instructions

Getting Started
---------------

Quick Start
~~~~~~~~~~~

AccelForge models the energy, area, and latency of accelerator architectures running
tensor algebra workloads. The basic workflow is:

1. **Define your architecture** - Specify the hardware components, their organization,
   and their energy/area characteristics
2. **Define your workload** - Specify the tensor operations you want to execute
3. **Map the workload to the architecture** - Use AccelForge's mapper to find efficient
   ways to execute your workload on the architecture
4. **Analyze results** - Examine the energy, area, and latency of the resulting
   mapping(s)

Basic Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's a minimal example of using AccelForge:

.. code-block:: python

   from accelforge import Spec

   # Load architecture and workload specifications
   spec = Spec.from_yaml_files(
       arch="examples/arches/simple.yaml",
       workload="examples/workloads/three_matmuls_annotated.yaml"
   )

   # Map the workload to the architecture
   results = spec.map_workload_to_arch()

   # Analyze the results
   print(f"Energy: {results.energy()} pJ")
   print(f"Latency: {results.latency()} seconds")


Examples
--------

Example Notebooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example Jupyter notebooks can be found by cloning the repository and navigating to the
``notebooks/`` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/Accelergy-Project/accelforge.git
   cd accelforge/notebooks/tutorials
   jupyter notebook

The tutorials include:

- **mapper.ipynb** - Mapping workloads to architectures
- **component_energy_area.ipynb** - Modeling component energy and area

Example Input Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example architecture, workload, and mapping YAML files can be found in the ``examples``
directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/Accelergy-Project/accelforge.git
   cd accelforge/examples
   ls

The examples directory contains:

- **arches/** - Example architecture specifications, including various published and
  commercial accelerators
- **workloads/** - Example workload specifications including matrix multiplications,
  convolutions, and transformer models
- **mappings/** - Example mapping specifications

**Architecture:** An architecture specification defines the hardware structure,
including hardware components and how they are organized into a system. See
:doc:`spec/architecture` for information on architecture specifications.

**Workload:** A workload specification defines what is executed on the architecture.
Workloads are expressed as a cascade of Einsums. See :doc:`spec/workload` for
information on workload specifications.

**Mapping:** A mapping specifies how a workload is executed on an architecture,
including where and when each operation is performed, and how data is moved and stored
in the hardware's components. See :doc:`spec/mapping` for information on mapping
specifications. AccelForge's mapper automatically finds optimal mappings. See the
``mapper.ipynb`` notebook for examples.
