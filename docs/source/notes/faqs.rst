Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

What unit is ... specified in?
------------------------------
We use un-prefixed units for all values. Joules, seconds, meters, square meters, bits,
etc.

Why are some attributes underscored?
------------------------------------

.. _underscore-discussion:

Underscore prefixes are used to indicate that a value is expected by the frontend. They
are used in places where there may be a mix of expected and unexpected values, such as
in a :py:class:`~fastfusion.frontend.arch.Component` ``attributes`` dictionary, where
``attributes`` may contain expected fields (such as
:py:obj:`~fastfusion.frontend.components.ComponentAttributes.n_instances`) and
unexpected fields (a field that may be used by ``hwcomponents
<https://github.com/Accelergy-Project/hwcomponents>`_, but not this package).

When a value is underscored, this package will check whether it is recognized and raise
an error if it is not. We recommend underscore-prefixing all fields that are going to be
used by this package. As a result, you may see attributes dictionaries that have a mix
of underscored and non-underscored fields. The underscored fields will be used by this
package, and the non-underscored fields will only be used by other parsers of the object
(such as `hwcomponents <https://github.com/Accelergy-Project/hwcomponents>`_).

When an object is initialized with underscore-prefixed fields, all underscores are
dropped after checking validity.
