Architecture
============

The architecture, defined by the :py:class:`~fastfusion.frontend.arch.Arch` class,
describes the hardware that is running the workload. An architecture is represented as a
tree, where branches in the tree represent different compute paths that may be taken.
For the rest of this section, we will assume that the architecture has been *flattened*,
meaning that there are no branches in the tree. The flattening procedure is described in
:ref:`flattening`.

A flattened architecture is a hierarchy of components with a
:py:class:`~fastfusion.frontend.arch.Compute` at the bottom. The following components
are supported:

- :py:class:`~fastfusion.frontend.arch.Memory` components store and reuse data.
- :py:class:`~fastfusion.frontend.arch.ProcessingStage` components perform some
  non-compute action (*e.g.,* quantizing or transferring data).
- :py:class:`~fastfusion.frontend.arch.Compute` components performs the Einsum's
  computation.

In the architecture file, each component is represented by a YAML dictionary. Component
types are preceded by the ``!`` character. An example architecture is shown below:

.. include:: ../../../examples/arches/tpu_v4i_like.arch.yaml
   :code: yaml


Sub-Branches
------------
Sub-branches in the architecture can represent different execution paths. The following
branch types are supported:

- :py:class:`~fastfusion.frontend.arch.Parallel` represents multiple parallel branches,
  one of which is executed.
- :py:class:`~fastfusion.frontend.arch.Hierarchical` represents a single hierarchy,
  where each node is a parent of the following nodes.

Sub-branches are written with the following syntax:

.. code-block:: yaml

  - !Memory
    ...

  - !Memory
    ...

  - !Parallel
    nodes:
    - !Hierarchical
      nodes:
      - ... # First-branch nodes
    - !Hierarchical
      nodes:
      - ... # Second-branch nodes

  # If more nodes go down here, they are children of the outer-level node, not the
  !Parallel node.
  - !Memory
    ...

The top-level :py:class:`~fastfusion.frontend.arch.Arch` is a
:py:class:`~fastfusion.frontend.arch.Hierarchical`.


Flattening
----------

A given Einsum may be executed only on a single
:py:class:`~fastfusion.frontend.arch.Compute`, and it may use hardware objects between
the root of the tree and the leaf for that
:py:class:`~fastfusion.frontend.arch.Compute`. Flattening an architecture converts a
tree architecture into multiple parallel *Flattened-Architectures*, each one
representing one possible path from the root of the tree to the leaf for that
:py:class:`~fastfusion.frontend.arch.Compute`.

For example, consider the following architecture:

.. include:: ../../../examples/arches/tpu_v4i_like.arch.yaml
   :code: yaml

There are two compute units in the architecture, the ``scalar_unit`` and the ``mac``.
Flattening this architecture will produce two Flattened-Architectures; one with a
``scalar_unit`` and one with a ``mac``. The partial mappings for each of these
architectures can be combined, and can share hardware that exists above both compute
units.
