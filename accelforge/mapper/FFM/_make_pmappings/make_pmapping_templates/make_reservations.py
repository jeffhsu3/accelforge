    # Rules:
    # - In general, reservations go right under their storage node
    # - If a storage node is associated with a fanout, explore putting the reservation
    #   below it, below the next storage node, and so on. Stop once we don't have any
    #   more spatial loops to place. Push down all reservations below this fanout
    #   together.

    # Spatial loops:
    # - Must go below all storage nodes associated with something above the fanout.
    #   -> Memories above fanout must serve all fetches across fanout instances.
    # - Must go above all reservations associated with something below the fanout.
    #   -> Memories below fanout must be reserved for each fanout instance.
    # - If below any storage node associated with the fanout, then must be relevant.
    #   -> No peer-to-peer communication

    # Temporal loops:
    # - If between a storage node and a reservation node, the outermost temporal loop
    #   may be partially relevant. All others must be relevant.

    # Design choices here:
    # - Where to put the 'fence' for each fanout
