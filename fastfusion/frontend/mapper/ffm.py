    If force_memory_hierarchy_order is set to False or is set to False for any
    particular component, and a spatial fanout ends up being raised above a storage node
    that does not have that fanout, then there may be cases where a spatial loop is put
    above a component that does not have the associated fanout.

    When this happens, we may not put between the spatial and the storage node any
    temporal loops that affect the same indexing expressions as the spatial loops.

    For example, the following is not allowed:

    Arch:

    - Global Buffer
    - 2x fanout
    - Register

    Mapping:

    spatial-for-reg n in [0, 10):
      [Register reuses input]
        for n in [0, 2):
          [Global Buffer reuses output]

    By default, if there are spatial loops that are not constrained away, then the
    mapper will not explore putting any temporal loops that conflict. In the above
    example, it will never place the above temporal loop. If this is set to True, then
    the mapper will explore removing the spatial loop in order to allow for the temporal
    loop to be placed. In the above example, it will explore removing the spatial loop
    in order to allow for the temporal loop to be placed.
